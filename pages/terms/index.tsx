            release 38,000 racehorses and will never, ever release any more
            thoroughbreds. As described below, the racehorses may breed
            offspring.

            As users breed their racehorses, new racehorses (offspring)
            GRANDERBY genotypes will be created. Using GRANDERBY’s proprietary
            algorithm, each thoroughbred created from breeding will have a
            unique profile value. Each offspring will carry over certain
            characteristics from its mother (mare) and its father (stallion)
            such as its bloodline, breed type and genotype.{' '}
          </li>
          <li>
            How you breed your thoroughbreds is entirely up to each user. The
            only restrictions that we place are that female (mare/filly) and
            male (stallion/colt) racehorses must mate together. In addition,
            male-to-male racehorses and female-to-female thoroughbreds cannot
            breed together and racehorses cannot breed with brothers, sisters,
            parents or grandparents.
          </li>
          <li>
            The gender outcome of each offspring is generated according to a
            pre-determined sequence and the offspring will always be owned by
            the female racehorse once the breeding transaction is complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            To most easily use GRANDERBY, we strongly recommend that you first
            install the Google Chrome web browser. Once you have installed
            Chrome, you will need to install a browser extension called
            MetaMask. MetaMask is an electronic digital wallet, which allows you
            to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Polygon or any
            other ERC-20 cryptocurrency. You will not be able to engage in any
            transactions on GRANDERBY other than through MetaMask (or other
            Polygon-compatible browsers) or an email address, where GRANDERBY
            creates a non-custodial electronic digital wallet for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            GRANDERBY will only recognize you as a user and you will only be
            able to interact with GRANDERBY, if your Polygon electronic digital
            wallet is connected and unlocked through your MetaMask account or
            your email address. There is no other way to sign up as a user, or
            to interact directly with GRANDERBY. BY USING OUR SERVICES YOU AGREE
            THAT YOU ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR
            THE APPLICABLE EXTENSIONS. FOR METAMASK, THOSE TERMS ARE AVAILABLE

            Transactions that take place on GRANDERBY are managed and confirmed
            via the Polygon blockchain, which is a proof of stake network, and a
            sidechain to the Polygon blockchain. The main Polygon blockchain
            is currently a proof of work network. Proof of stake networks use
            less energy than proof of work networks. You understand that your
            Polygon public address will be made publicly visible whenever you
            engage in a transaction on GRANDERBY.

            Polygon requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for
            every transaction that occurs on the Polygon network. The Gas Fee

            network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each
            transaction that occurs via the App.

          <li>
            In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract
            to conduct a transaction with another user via GRANDERBY, you
            authorize GRANDERBY to collect a commission on certain events only
            (a “Commission”). These events include purchasing, selling or
            breeding of a thoroughbred on the App. You acknowledge and agree
            that the Commission will be transferred directly to us through the
            Polygon network as part of your payment.
